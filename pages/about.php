					  <span>Projectees! Prounounced 'Project-eez', as in the plural for people who are part of a project. Like 'employees' except without the pension plans or dresscodes, BUT, with much more fun!</span><br><span>For further clarification, and mention of the term 'Project-er' does not refer to the technological wonder that turns walls into big TV screens, but rather the leader or owner of a project. Again, similar to 'employer' but without the constant dread of tax returns and leadership courses.</span>

				  <div class="collapsible-header"><h2>"But...what is Projectees?"</h2></div>
				  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>'What isn't Projectees?' is the question you should be asking yourself! Well, not really, there's a lot of things that Projectees isn't - it won't cook your breakfast for you, at least not in this version anyway, who knows what the future holds?</span><br><span>What Projectees is, is a platform that enables super-productive people like you (if you aren't, just pretend you are) to find other super-productive people who can help you get some stuff done. What 'stuff'? Anything! It could be that idea you had once when you were lying in bed and couldn't get to sleep and you're sure it 'would make so much money if I made it'. Well, do it!</span></div>

				  <div class="collapsible-header"><h2>"How exactly does it work?"</h2></div>
				  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Step 1, become a Projectee. Step 2, start a project. Step 3, assemble your team and reach for the stars (careful, they're hot)!</span></div>

				  <div class="collapsible-header"><h2>"When did Projectees appear?"</h2></div>
				  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>2018, so it's brand spanking new! That means it's all shiny and you have an opportunity to become one of those cool early adopters that everyone thinks is wise and, like, just so 'with it' y'know?</span></div>

				<li class="active">
				  <div class="collapsible-header"><h2>"Why did Projectees appear?"</h2></div>
				  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Once upon a time, Projectees' founder couldn't find anywhere to get help with his super ambitious project ideas. He was sad. It was not good. So, he decided to make something that would allow him to find people to work with (Projectees, if that wasn't clear)!</span></div>
